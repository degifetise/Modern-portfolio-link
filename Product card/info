<h1>About me</h1>
I'm Degife Tise, a Front-End Developer from Sidama, Ethiopia, 
focused on building responsive and interactive websites that 
blend clean design with smooth user experience. I specialize 
in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, Bootstrap, and Tailwind
 CSS, creating scalable and dynamic web interfaces.

My journey began with a passion for using tech to support
 education and community growth. Today, I craft meaningful
 digital solutions for local businesses, student groups, 
and tech initiatives. I write clean code, optimize layouts
 for all devices, and design with both performance and accessibility in mind.

Beyond development, I lead educational projects, translate
 resources, and create tools that make learning more engaging. 
Whether it’s a portfolio, landing page, or group platform, 
I bring creativity, precision, and a user-first mindset to every project.

Let’s build something impactful together.
